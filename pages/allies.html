                    <h3>Alfred Pennyworth</h3>
                    <p>A British special forces veteran turned butler, Alfred Pennyworth is the most loyal friend and
                        confidant of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. </p>
                    <p>
                        Alfred Pennyworth is more than just Bruce Wayne’s butler, or Batman’s confidant. Alfred is a
                        second father to Wayne, and serves as his conscience when the never-ending fight against evil
                        wears on the Caped Crusader. Pennyworth keeps the Bat-Family together through his compassion and
                        leadership. He has not only raised Bruce Wayne, but also the four young men who have worn the
                        mask of Robin, the Boy Wonder: Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and now, Damian Wayne.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a former British intelligence officer, field medic and trained Shakespearean actor, Alfred is
                        uniquely suited to support the lives of masked crime fighters. He's quick with a disguise, a
                        cover story, an alibi; and quicker still with a suture, a cast or an ice bath. He ensures that
                        Wayne Manor—all of Wayne Manor, including the vast Batcave—is operating at peak performance
                        while the Bat-Family patrols the city. Plus, he makes a mean cucumber sandwich, which may not be
                        something he lists on his resume, but is certainly something everyone who sets foot on the
                        manor's grounds will fondly remember.

                    <h3>Robin</h3>
                    <p>Tim Drake possesses detective skills comparable to those of his mentor Batman, though his heart
                        may be his greatest weapon. </p>
                    <p> Growing up in Gotham City can be…complicated. Especially when you're a kid who’s obsessed with
                        Batman and Robin. For Tim Drake, learning everything about his favorite superheroes eventually
                        led him down the path of becoming one himself, after he deduced the identities of Bruce Wayne
                        and Dick Grayson.</p>
                    <p> A self-made hero in every sense of the word, Tim took on the role of Robin after attempting to
                        convince Dick Grayson to become Batman’s sidekick again following the death of Jason Todd. In
                        Tim's mind, Batman needed a Robin to stay true to himself and his mission. Although Tim didn't
                        intend to take up the mantle for himself, he was more than happy to do what needed to be done.
                    </p>
                    <p> Analytical almost to a fault, Tim represents the "brains" of the Batman Family's roster of
                        onetime Robins. As a Teen Titan and a founding member of Young Justice, Tim's excelled as both
                        leader and mentor…though following in Batman's footsteps is anything but his dream..</p>

                        and
                        joined Batman's crusade right under her father’s nose.

                        The mean streets of Gotham City have a number of guardian angels watching over them. And one of
                        the
                        first—the young woman who turned the Dynamic Duo into the Batman family—was Batgirl. Barbara
                        Gordon
                        has always existed between two worlds: her life at home as the only daughter of Police
                        Commissioner
                        James Gordon and her life swinging from gargoyles as an associate of the Dark Knight and a

                        member of the Birds of Prey.

                    <p>
                        Though the two halves of her life don’t always mesh, she stays true to the things she believes

                    <p>If it’s hard being a superhero, what is it like as a sidekick? The heroes get the glory, while
                        you clean up the mess. You don’t make the decisions and you don’t give orders. So, what do you
                        do if you’re the Boy Wonder to one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and
                        you’re looking to break out on your own? </p>
                    <p> Simple. You become Nightwing.</p>
                    <p> When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire
                        and bat-friendly super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young
                        boy and eventually molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew
                        older, playing second fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him,
                        and eventually he struck out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming
                        into his own as a respected member of the superhero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is
                        simple—if you’re breaking the law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short
                        and most assuredly painful trip to Arkham.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do.
                        He doesn’t want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s
                        accomplished while avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can
                        Nightwing be as effective as he ultimately wants to be?</p>

                    <h3>Catwoman</h3>
                    <p>As deadly as she is beautiful, infamous cat-burglar Selina Kyle uses her nine lives to walk the
                        razor's edge between light and darkness in Gotham City. </p>
                    <p>

                        The Bat may be the king of the beasts of Gotham. But the Cat? The Cat is definitely the queen.
                        Infamous burglar Selina Kyle is certainly one of the most iconic characters in the DC
                        Universe—not because she's a superhero, per se, but because she's so good at stumping them.
                        Motivated partly by her own self interest, partly by the fun of it all, Catwoman has been
                        baffling Gotham City's heroes, both masked and unmasked, from the very beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An accomplished jewel thief and an occasional hero herself, Selina's murky moral compass has
                        made her relationship with Batman complicated, to say the least. Still, the undeniable magnetism
                        between Bat and Cat is one of Gotham's most reliable constants: wherever Catwoman goes, Batman
                        is sure to follow, if only to take her down. It's a complicated game of cat-and-mouse
                        (cat-and-bat?) that Bruce and Selina have been playing across the streets and rooftops of Gotham
                        for a long, long time.

                    <h3>James Gordon</h3>
                    <p>Not all heroes in Gotham City wear masks. GCPD Commissioner James Gordon is the Dark Knight's
                        greatest ally, and one of his closest friends. </p>
                    <p>
                        Batman may be the sworn guardian of Gotham City, but the man who makes it possible for the Dark
                        Knight to safeguard its streets is James Gordon. A veteran cop who rose through the ranks by
                        putting his foot down on rampant corruption—even when that stalwart devotion to justice came at
                        great personal cost—Gordon worked tirelessly on Gotham’s police force, eventually earning
                        himself the title of commissioner.
                    </p>
                    <p> One of the first GCPD officers to accept the Batman’s help, Gordon was responsible for one of
                        the Gotham skyline’s most iconic features: the Bat-Signal, a tool that only he is authorized to
                        use. Despite being given many opportunities to learn Batman’s identity, Gordon has never done
                        so, valuing their partnership and the Dark Knight’s ability to maintain plausible deniability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gordon remains one of Batman’s closest friends and most trusted confidants outside the
                        Bat-Family, and the most vital part of his job fighting crime in Gotham City.</p>
